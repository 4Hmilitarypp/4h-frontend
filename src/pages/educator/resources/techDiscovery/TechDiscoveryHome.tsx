      <Heading>DoD-USDA Partnerships: Tech Discovery Curriculum</Heading>
      <P>
        The Tech Discovery Curriculum is designed for 5th-12th grade military connected youth from all branches of
        service. It is focused on developing life skills and increased resiliency supporting military connected families
        during times of deployment and reintegration back into normal life. These educational experiences are designed
        to be delivered in group learning environments utilizing an experiential learning methodology. These experiences
        are a great support to youth development programs such as Yellow Ribbon; camps focused on military children,
        youth and families; Family Readiness Groups; etc. The curriculum includes 35 youth and family educational
        experiences that focus on building skills in Communication, Teamwork, Self-responsibility, Decision Making and
        Problem Solving while at the same time supporting enhancement of youth resilience in their emotional, social,
        family and spiritual (their set of beliefs, principles and values that give them strength) realms.
      </P>
      <P>
        The Tech Discovery activity plans are only available on-line. Each state and territory has received 1-2 Tech
        Discovery Tool Kits that are accessible to community and military partners who will be implementing the Tech
        Discovery curriculum. Tool Kits provide most of the durable goods needed to implement these educational
        experiences. Priority in scheduling use of the Tech Discovery Tool Kits is to be given to supporting military
        connected youth with a parent from the Reserve Component / geographically dispersed.
      </P>
      <P>
        NOTE: Because of the more technical context of these activities, volunteers and staff leading the activities
        will need a fair amount of planning and preparation time. Please plan accordingly. Additional supplies not found
        in the Tech Discovery Tool Kits will have to be secured as well.
      </P>

      Inquiry-based Learning, "Thinking Like a Scientist" - Facilitating inquiry experiences requires flexibility,
      patience, tolerance of ambiguity, and an emphasis on student skill building. When learner-driven inquiry takes
      place, the instructor becomes a learner, too.
