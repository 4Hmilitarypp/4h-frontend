              The National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
              developed partnerships with the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, National Guard and Reserves, to
              support youth and family programs on installations around the world.
            </P>
            <P>Youth and families from U.S. Marines and U.S. Coast Guard are also supported.</P>
            <P>
              4-H extension professionals support military staff as they provide strong educational programs so that
              military men and women can pursue their critical, high risk assignments knowing that their children are in
              safe and nurturing environments.
            </P>
            <P>
              4-H clubs provide quality educational experiences to military youth using research based curricula for
              military youth ages 5-18.
            </P>
            <P>
              4-H clubs have been established on nearly every Army, Navy, and Air Force installation worldwide, while
              4-H clubs in communities have opened their doors to military youth living off installation as well as
              youth of National Guard and Reserve families.
            </P>
            <P>
              As a parent's military role causes frequent family moves, 4-H clubs provide predictability and stability
              throughout the military child's life.
            </P>
            <P>
              In 2015, more than<b> 45,616 </b>Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves
              children and youth participated in 4-H military clubs on and off installations.

          <P>
            National 4-H Curriculum focuses on 4-Hâ€™s three primary mission mandates: science, healthy living, and
            citizenship. In addition, there is a wide variety of curriculum and project topic areas offered through the
            state and county 4-H programs.
          </P>
          <P>
            If there is a project area youth are interested in knowing more about, 4-H has a curriculum that can support
            the learning initiative and guide activities. View the

          <P>
            As a result of the<A href="/partners/army"> Army 4-H Military Partnership</A>, over<b> 23,000 </b>Army
            children and youth participate in approximately<b> 332 </b>4-H Clubs on Army installations worldwide. These
            clubs have become an integral programming component for Army School-Age and Youth programs.
          </P>
          <P>
            4-H Clubs offer opportunities for Army youth to explore new interests and gain skills in leadership,
            decision making, technology, science, math, environmental stewardship, and community service. In addition to
            learning-by-doing in their club, Army youth participate with other 4-H youth beyond the garrison gates in
            county, state and national programs. No matter where a family moves, the youth can find 4-H Clubs in any
            county in the U.S. and on overseas installations.

          <P>
            As a result of the<A href="/partners/air-force"> Air Force 4-H Military Partnership</A>, more than
            <b> 17,500 </b>Air Force children and youth participated in approximately<b> 234 </b>4-H Clubs as of 2013.
            Clubs are one of the primary ways 4-H provides positive youth development opportunities to meet the needs of
            young people so they can experience Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity, the 4-H Essential
            Elements, and to foster educational opportunities through the Land Grant University system.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Air Force requires that at least three 4-H Clubs are offered on base using official 4-H curriculum. One
            of the clubs must be in the area of Health, Nutrition, & Fitness; the remaining clubs should revolve around
            the varied interests of the youth. The Air Force 4-H Club can be a community club with three (or more)
            project groups offered throughout the year under the community club.
