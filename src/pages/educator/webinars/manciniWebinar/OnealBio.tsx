      Catherine Walker O’Neal, has held the position of post-doctoral research fellow within the Department of Human
      Development and Family Science at the University of Georgia since completing her Ph.D. in 2011. Dr. O’Neal’s work
      has focused on social determinants of health and well-being during life stages or contexts typically defined by
      high levels of transition and change (for example, adolescence, later adulthood, and military families). Within
      the Family and Community Resilience Laboratory, she also manages the data collected from two expansive surveys of
      military youth and their families (almost 2,000 respondents in total) and oversees statistical analyses and
      publications stemming from these data.
    </P>
    <P>
      Dr. O’Neal has published her research in periodicals such as Journal of Marriage and Family, Family Relations,
      Journal of Family Theory and Review, Journal of Health Psychology, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, Journal of
      Adolescence, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, and The Gerontologist. She is currently working with
      colleagues on a book that will serve as a practical guide to advanced statistical methods for social science
      researchers, namely higher-order growth curves and growth mixture modeling. Current and forthcoming publications
      are in Military Medicine, Health Psychology, Journal of Research on Adolescence, and Journal of Applied
      Developmental Psychology.

      Dr. O’Neal’s current research focuses on the use of advanced statistical techniques to shed new light on the
      influences of contextual risk and protective factors, primarily family and social environments, on physical,
      mental, and relational health outcomes with an emphasis on the interdependent nature of close relationships. In
      addition to active research projects with Dr. Jay Mancini, she is an investigator on a longitudinal project
      assessing change in marital quality and health in later life, which was recently-funded by the National Institute
      on Aging (through NIH).
